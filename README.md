# Telekinesis Mage Avatar Base

Holding items with your hands is boring, hold them with your mind instead!

## Known issues

- Avatar does not work with default permissions
- Using with shaders causes minor visual issues
- Drawing back bows or other actions that change how an item looks don't work properly
- Elytra is never visible
- No jumping, creative flying or floating while not moving in water animations (they're just the mid-air animations)
- No running animation (it's just the walking animation played very slightly faster)
- Walking very slowly (such as when blocking with a shield) looks a tad wonky

I probably won't fix these issues, the avatar is complex enough as is! Tho if i see a lot of demand i might...
